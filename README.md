# Excel-Pixelart
A simple pixel art program on an Excel sheet.
Written in VBA Excel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications).

## Why VBA Excel? Nobody seems to use it
I don't have any statistics on VBA Excel use in the world, but it surely has to be fairly low.
However, VBA Excel is the first programming language that I experienced with when I was 13 years old, so it's a bit nostalgic to me. :-)

VBA is quite old (according to Wikipedia, it was declared legacy in 2008), but it still seems like a very powerful way to use Excel.

## Disclaimer
Always be careful when executing VBA code from someone else. Make sure you trust the developper or read and understand the source code beforehand.

## How to use the pixel art program
The file is very easy to use:
- Click the button of the color you want to use
- Click the cell you want to color

OR

- Select the cells you want to color
- Click the button of the color you want

A 'CLEAN BOARD' button is there to clean the drawing area.

## The file will be updated
The following things will soon be coded:
- Avoid drawing outside the drawing area
- A button set to create your own colors
- 2-3 templates of already-drawn grids
